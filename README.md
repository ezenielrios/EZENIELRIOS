### Hi there 👋! welcome to my Github! 

🌱 I’m addicted to learning and growing every day

🔭 I'm currently working on an eCommerce site. I'm utilizing a mix of the following:
-React-Router
-Firebase
-Redux
-Stripe Api
-Styled components
-Redux-Saga
-Hooks
-Context Api
-GraphQL
-TypeScript

and ofcourse they'll be plenty of testing and QA.  

🎓 I'm attending DeVry University in my senior year for my B.S Information Technology & Networking concentration in Cyber Security graduating 12/22

🎓 I have also been awarded my A.A.S in Information Technology and Networking concentration Network Administration from DeVry on 2/22.
