Welcome to my GitHub 👋  
I’m a cybersecurity-focused IT professional building and documenting realistic, enterprise-style security labs. My work emphasizes network foundations, security analysis, structured adversarial testing, and evidence-based documentation aligned with real-world security operations.

I focus on **how systems are designed, tested, and defended**—not just which tools are used.
